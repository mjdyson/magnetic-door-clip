# magnetic-door-clip
A magnetic door clip, designed with Voron 3d printers in mind

Credit to @chrisrgonzales for his 270 degree hinge mod - this takes a lot of his design.

The provided STL files are sized to accommodate
* 2mm panel thickness
* 3mm foam thickness
* 0.8mm VHB tape thickness

Design features:
* Holes for heatset inserts are provided.
* F3d file is parameterised to allow editing of the total thickness. This adjusts the latch design to accommodate different sized foam/panels
* Only a single 6mm x 3mm magnetic disc is required as the M3 caphead screw provides the magnetic counterpart

Please raise issues if you'd like to suggest changes.
